                blockchain. While we can remove your Submission from showing on wallet.com we cannot alter or remove your post from the
                BSV blockchain. Your post will live there forever for as long as related data hosting services hold it.

                <p>Data protection provisions about the use of PayPal as a payment processor</p>
                <p>
                  On this website, the controller has integrated components of PayPal. PayPal is an online payment service provider.
                  Payments are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual private or business accounts. PayPal is also
                  able to process virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal account is
                  managed via an e-mail address, which is why there are no classic account numbers. PayPal makes it possible to trigger
                  online payments to third parties or to receive payments. PayPal also accepts trustee functions and offers buyer protection
                  services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. &amp; Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449
                  Luxembourg, Luxembourg.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the data subject chooses "PayPal" as the payment option during the online ordering process, we automatically transmit
                  the data of the data subject to PayPal. By selecting this payment option, the data subject agrees to the transfer of
                  personal data required for payment processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name, last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone
                  number, mobile phone number, or other data necessary for payment processing. The processing of the purchase contract also
                  requires such personal data, which are in connection with the respective order.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud prevention. The controller will transfer personal
                  data to PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the transmission is given. The personal data exchanged between
                  PayPal and the controller for the processing of the data will be transmitted by PayPal to economic credit agencies. This
                  transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  PayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service providers or subcontractors to the extent that
                  this is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be processed in the order.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from PayPal. A
                  revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with

                  <strong>EXERCISING ACCESS, DATA PORTABILITY, AND DELETION RIGHTS</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request
                  to us by sending us a message on our website. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that
                  you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may
                  also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The
                  verifiable consumer request must:
                </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>
                    Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal
                    Information or an authorized representative.
                  </li>
                  <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority
                  to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or
                  authority to make the request.
                </p>
                <p>Response Timing and Format</p>
                <p>
                  We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we
                  will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
                </p>
                <p>We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
                <p>
                  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The
                  response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability
                  requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to
                  transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail
                  communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
                  manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and
                  provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>OPT-OUT AND OPT-IN RIGHTS</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your Personal Information at any time
                  (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of
                  age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16
                  years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal
                  Information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us at email:
                  privacy@creartive-it.com.
                </p>
                <p>We will only use Personal Information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>NON-DISCRIMINATION</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. However, note that many features of our
                  Mobile Application, our products, or our services will not function without your Personal Information. Unless permitted by
                  the CCPA, we will not:
                </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                  <li>
                    Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or
                    imposing penalties.
                  </li>
                  <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                  <li>
                    Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or
                    services.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates,
                  or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s
                  value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive
                  program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Moible Application that are
                  California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for
                  their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send us an electronic message through our Mobile
                  Application or write us at our email address listed on our webpage.

                  We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date
                  and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy,
                  we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
